# Introduction

React Docs UI is a React component library and toolset designed specifically for building modern documentation websites. Its core philosophy is **configuration over code**, allowing you to focus entirely on content creation.

## Core Advantages

- **Configuration-Driven**: This is the core feature of React Docs UI. You don't need to write complex React components or routing logic; just maintain a clear `site.yaml` file to define everything from the site's navigation and sidebar to its theme and footer.

- **Fully-Featured**: Out-of-the-box, it provides everything a modern documentation website needs:
  - Responsive layout
  - Light/dark theme switching
  - Markdown-based content rendering (with GFM and Frontmatter support)
  - Built-in code syntax highlighting
  - Quick command menu (Cmd+K)
  - Internationalization support

- **Extremely Simple to Start**: With the official `create-react-docs-ui` scaffolding tool, you can launch a fully functional documentation website in under a minute, without any complex environment setup.

- **Highly Customizable**: While it works out-of-the-box, every part (like the logo, color scheme, navigation links, social media icons, etc.) can be deeply customized through the configuration file.

## Use Cases

Whether you are an individual developer or part of a team, React Docs UI is perfect for the following scenarios:

- **Open Source Project Documentation**: Provide a professional and easy-to-maintain documentation site for your React project.
- **Product Manuals**: Clearly present your product's features and usage guides.
- **Team Knowledge Bases**: Build and share knowledge based on React technology within your team.
- **Personal Blogs or Portfolios**: Organize and display your technical articles or projects in an elegant way.
