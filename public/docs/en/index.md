# React Docs UI

A **configuration-driven** modern documentation website builder based on React.

React Docs UI aims to make creating beautiful, powerful documentation websites simpler than ever. You just need to focus on writing Markdown documents, and everything else—from routing and navigation to theme switching and the command menu—is driven by a simple YAML configuration.

## Core Features

- **Configuration-Driven**: Define your entire website via `site.yaml` without coding.
- **Out-of-the-Box**: Quickly start your project with all necessary features built-in.
- **Modern Design**: Elegant responsive layout with automatic light/dark theme switching.
- **Command Menu**: Built-in `Cmd+K` shortcut menu for quick page access.
- **Markdown Support**: Full support for GFM and Frontmatter.
- **Internationalization**: Easily implement multi-language support through configuration files.

## Quick Start

Get your own documentation website with just one command:

```bash
# Create the project
npx create-react-docs-ui@latest my-docs

# Enter the project directory
cd my-docs

# Install dependencies and start
npm install && npm run dev
```
